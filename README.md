**Project Objective:**
					This project mainly deals with a model social media website page which consists of an Azure Bot.

**Project Description:**
						This project is purely based only on HTML and few concepts of Java Script and W3 spaces accessories were also included. Apart from these technologies I have used Azure Bot and Static web apps services in my project. My main aim is to develop a Social media model with a Bot. I have created just a single web page in which I have included the bot also. I hope this project would be a successful one in describing how to chain up a bot with a social media paltform.


Azure Technologies used are **Azure Health bot services and static apps.**
